## Tesse

Hello,

Please find the assignment details below:

- Code: https://github.com/rakesh-gupta29/tesser-assignment
- Preview link: https://tesser-assignment.vercel.app/

Please consider the following while reviewing the assignment:

- I did not take all the colors from DS but only which I had to use
- We can migrate some CSS to use variables instead but avoided it to save time.
- No styled components were used. All the CSS is written by me.
- I have used Media queries at couple of places to maintain responsiveness.

## Features and Decisions

- Created atomic components with stylings for cohesiveness.
- Maintained keyboard navigation for all the components.
- Basic form validation is done. I assumed some fields to be optional so skipped validation for them.
- Some color inconsistencies are there but I tried to maintain the theme as much as possible.

## Time takes

- around 1 day
- could not devote more time because of office work.
